Description: Develop a simple task manager application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users should be able to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and view their task list.

Features:

    Task Management: Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
    Task Categories: Users can organize tasks into categories (e.g., work, personal, shopping).
    User Interface: Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the application.
    Persistence: Implement functionality to save tasks to a file/database so that users can access their tasks across multiple sessions.
    Search and Filtering: Allow users to search for tasks by name or filter tasks based on their status (completed/incomplete) or category.
    Reminders: Implement optional reminders for upcoming tasks.
    User Authentication (Optional): Add basic user authentication functionality to allow multiple users to have their own task lists.

Additional Challenges:

    Implement sorting functionality to sort tasks by due date, priority, or other criteria.
    Allow users to set due dates and priorities for tasks.
    Implement data validation to ensure that users provide valid inputs.
    Create unit tests to validate the functionality of different components of the application.
    Extend the application to support task collaboration among multiple users.
